# BUILD_LOG — Shop Board
Chronological build journal. Every work chunk gets an entry (Q99). Newest first.

## 2026-07-25 — Build block 2 — sign-in live + database seeded
- Q95 decided (hold Logsdon accounts) -> register Q1-Q105 has ZERO open items.
- Migration 0002_seed.sql run + verified: 4 lines, 6 templates, 16 products, 6 employees, 165 steps, 68 options, 23 pick items, 9 toggles. Man-hour sums match all six standards.
- server.js v2: name-grid sign-in, first-login choose-your-PIN (Q68), scrypt PIN hashes (Q22), C17 per-person lockout, HMAC session cookies, event_log writes.
- Railway env vars: SUPABASE_URL + SESSION_SECRET (me), SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (owner-rep pasted — new Supabase 'secret key' sb_secret_... = service_role).
- BUG FIXED via deploy logs: db 403 — tables created as postgres lacked service_role grants. Fix: GRANT all on tables/sequences + default privileges (anon gets nothing, spec s10).
- E2E TEST PASSED on shopboard.premierstreetrod.com (DNS + SSL live): test account PIN-set -> home (line lookup correct) -> logout -> wrong PIN rejected -> re-login. event_log: 5 events in order. Test account deactivated -> gone from grid (Q70 proven).
- NEXT: clock-in/out (clock_event + Q52 Wi-Fi gate) + first cab screen or TV board skeleton.

## 2026-07-24 — GO hour, part 2 — DEPLOYED: full stack live
- Railway: repo connected (fix was completing the Railway-side GitHub authorization; the app install alone showed no repos). First deploy SUCCESS, service Online, auto-deploy on push ENABLED.
- Live: shop-board-production.up.railway.app — shell page serves, /health returns {ok:true} (Q74 watchdog target).
- Custom domain shopboard.premierstreetrod.com added (port 8080). Owner-rep placed CNAME (shopboard -> 2c5tuivf.up.railway.app) + TXT (_railway-verify.shopboard) at GoDaddy; Railway auto-verifies + SSL on propagation.
- Supabase: org Premier Street Rod (PRO), project shopboard-prod (ca-central-1). Migration 0001 run in SQL Editor — Success; verified 12/12 tables present by query.
- GitHub web editor is the canonical path this session; zip/Terminal route retired. Token rotation at cutover. Railway trial: add card before 28 days/$5 runs out.
- NEXT BLOCK: kiosk name-grid sign-in + seed data (employees file 26, catalogs files 27/29/30/31/33/34). Run as 'On your computer' task for direct network.

## 2026-07-24 — GO — Stage 1 begins
- Owner-rep approved Build Spec v1.0 + SPEC-DEFAULTs and said GO.
- Repo created via GitHub web (cloud sandbox cannot push directly — see design folder 02 log).
- Files: package.json, server.js (zero-dep shell + /health for the Q74 watchdog),
supabase/migrations/0001_core.sql (core schema + append-only event log), docs/EVENT_TAXONOMY.md.
- NEXT: run 0001 in Supabase SQL editor, deploy to Railway, custom domain + GoDaddy CNAME.
- Standing note: build blocks should run as 'On your computer' tasks so pushes/deploys are direct.
